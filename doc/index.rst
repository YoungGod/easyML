Welcome to easyML's documentation!
============================================

easyML is a python package designed to streamline the process of analyzing
datasets using predictive models. It covers crutial aspects the of data 
analysis process starting from preprocessing, moving to feature engineering 
and finally predictive modeling.

They key advantage of this package is the data block feature using which you can create a block of your data at the start of analysis. Now you can just call different functions which seemlessly integrate with your data. It definitely comes at the cost of loss of generalization as compared to the raw scikit-learn features, but the idea is to have a good coverage and provide options for flexibility. The package is particularly useful for begineers and intermediate level python data science enthusiasts, who are looking to get the job done without worrying about the code.

Use the following to get started:

    .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 3
       
       api
       

How can you contribute?
=======================

What you see now is an alpha-version of the package. I have defined a framework with a class structure having clear dataflow. The module contains some fundamental modules. There's still a lot to be done as there are lots of cool modules to be added. I have my upcoming functions list in each module.

I'm sure if you are a serious analyst/data scientist, you would have many such wrappers of your own. I would love to hear about them and it'll be great if you contrinute your ideas/code. Even if you don't have the code, feel free to add feature requests for things you would like see.

To get started:

* Fork the github repo - 
* Install package using PyPi -
